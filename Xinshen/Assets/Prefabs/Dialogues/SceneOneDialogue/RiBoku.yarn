Ri Boku, the finest baker in the empire, "I didn’t choose the rolling pin, the rolling pin chose me” - Talentwise, Ri Boku was truly a man who comes along once every thousand years. Rather than using his gifts to divide us through conquest, he instead used them to unite us through the kingdom’s most delicious baked goods. His motto, "I want to make cookies to die for” is known throughout the land. His tasty treats had no equal and his sugary passion was infectious to all.

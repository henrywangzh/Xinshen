Hi everyone this is Studio Xinshen's GitHub Repository.

## Guide for command line Git users

If you have experience using Git or would like to use the command line:

In your preferred directory, run:
git clone [git url of repo]

#### To push changes:

git add .
git commit -m "my message"
git push

#### to pull changes:

git pull

you may have issues with merge conflicts that you can resolve with git merge and choosing main/origin.

It's because of this that we recommend using GitHub Desktop


## Guide for GitHub Desktop

To start, please download GitHub Desktop and log in with your GitHub account.

Add the repository and use the UI elements to push, pull, and view changes.
